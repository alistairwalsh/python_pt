For my project, I am wanting to combine the use of a scraper with some data manipulation.

The project would be a python script that can be run on a website.

It would input every valid postcode into the search bar, scrape the output loaded for information such as address, coordindates etc.
and then input the results into a .csv spreadsheet.

There would need to be some data cleaning that would have to occur as well, removing useless information and removing duplicates to new a few.
